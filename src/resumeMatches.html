              About the Role
            </p>
            <p>

              At Care Options for Kids, a home health care company providing 1:1 care in the home, we do things a little
              differently. There's no revolving door of patients or hospital setting chaos — blinking call lights,
              scurrying doctors, and wards bursting at the seams.
            </p>
            <p>

              Instead, you work with self-sufficient autonomy, empowered to make a real difference in your clients'
              lives. We value your clinical knowledge and respect the deep one-on-one bond you establish with the
              families you care for. Of course, if you need anything, your RN Clinician is only a phone call away — we
              offer 24-hour, 365-day support and on-demand clinical resources.
            </p>
            <p>

              A Day in the Life of a Care Options for Kids Nurse
            </p>
            <p>

              You start your day by touching base with your care team, whether that's mom, dad, or the nurse you are
              relieving. For added ease, in-depth information on your client is available in our dedicated EHR platform.
            </p>
            <p>

              Your client greets you warmly. Though she's non-verbal, she'll smile and reach out to touch your face and
              put her head to your chest for a cuddle — she's excited to see you. After disconnecting her ventilator,
              which she only needs at night, it's time for breakfast and a light sponge bath.
            </p>
            <p>

              From there, every day is a new adventure. You may decide to head outdoors to gaze at clouds, hunt for
              ladybugs, or make flower crowns. You may set up a living room campout or travel back in time with a book
              until it's time for lunch.
            </p>
            <p>

              Throughout the day, you prepare and deliver her medications and perform her routine trach and g-tube care
              — documenting the dosages and treatments within your dedicated EHR platform, where you're able to view and
              compare notes and assessments easily and electronically. While your client takes a late afternoon nap, you
              finalize your electronic documentation and touch base with the relieving member of your care team before
              heading home.
            </p>
            <p>

              Whatever the day brings, a day in the life of a Care Options for Kids nurse feels less like work and more
              like caring for family. It's an opportunity to build your clinical expertise while shaping the lives of
              your client and their loved ones every single day.
            </p>
